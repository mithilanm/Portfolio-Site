              I'm a recent Mechatronics Engineering and Managment graduate from
              McMaster University
            </h2>
            <p class="p-first text-white">
              I enjoy working with technology, whether that be hardware,
              software or the combination of both to solve complex problems.I
              also have a knack for artistic designs in the form of animations
              and graphic design. I love working on short animations and using
              photoshop to create graphic designs. I recently discovered my
              passion for web development which in my opinion perfectly combines
              my passion of software and design. In fact, this website was
              completely created by myself! As far as my other hobbies go I love
              working out and playing/watching basketball (huge raptors fan
              here). In my spare time I love listening to music, primarily hip
              hop and R&B as you can tell from my design projects. I also love
              collecting vinyl records of my favourite albums.
            </p>

              On this website, you can find my resume as well as media on some
              of the projects I have worked on over the years, described in my
              resume. In addition, I have provided contact information where you
              can contact me.
