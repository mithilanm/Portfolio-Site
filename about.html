        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>
          I'm a recent Mechatronics Engineering and Management graduate from
          McMaster University
        </h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy working with technology, whether that be hardware, software or
          the combination of both to solve complex problems.I also have a knack
          for artistic designs in the form of animations and graphic design. I
          love working on short animations and using photoshop to create graphic
          designs. I recently discovered my passion for web development which in
          my opinion perfectly combines my passion of software and design. When
          I'm not working on projects, you can find me in the gym working out,
          on the court playing basketball, listening to music or playing video
          games.
